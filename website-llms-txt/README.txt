Automatically generate and manage LLMS.txt files for LLM/AI content understanding, with full Yoast SEO and RankMath integration.

== Description ==

Website LLMs.txt helps your website become discoverable in the age of generative AI.

This plugin automatically generates an LLMs.txt file — a simple, structured list of important public URLs from your site — designed specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and other AI systems.
It works much like a traditional XML sitemap, but is optimized for the way AI agents read and learn from the web.

The plugin integrates seamlessly with popular SEO tools like Yoast SEO, Rank Math, and now AIOSEO, automatically excluding content marked as noindex or nofollow.

✅ Future-proof your site for AI discovery
